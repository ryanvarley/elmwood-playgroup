<p>We are very sad to announce that Playgroup will close permanently on Thursday 12th July 2018:</p>

<p>Due to the increasing number of local Nursery's now offering "Free" childcare to 2-5 year olds and some also offering sessional sessions, the numbers of children registering with Playgroup has gradually fallen over the past couple of years, whilst the numbers of children registered with Playgroup this year has been steady the actual number of sessions taken has been too low to allow us to pay our way.</p>

<p>We assure you we will continue to deliver the Very Best Professional care to all our families and children up to the day we close. It has been an absolute pleasure to have been involved at Playgroup over the years and we take this opportunity to give our sincere thanks to all the families who have supported Playgroup over the past 57 years at Elmwood.</p>

<p>Many thanks to our wonderful girls Cath, Joanne and Jacqui who's professionalism, care and commitment has been outstanding without them and ourselves working voluntary days we would have had to close some time ago.</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>

<p>Chris Small and Tina Hind,</p>

<p>Partners / Leaders</p>
